## Notes
### About operating system - Ubuntu 22.04 Only
For this project, we only recommend linux systems, especially Ubuntu 22.04, which is compatible with ROS2 humble and other platforms. We know that you may be a Windows or Mac user. We have been experimenting with various methods, including WSLs and virtual machines, in an attempt to get the project to run stably on a variety of operating system environments. However, we've encountered a variety of bugs in the process, and we've spent a lot of time working through existing bugs, and we're not sure if new bugs will show up on your PC. We'd like to save you and us the energy of configuring the environment on your project and focus more on the course content itself, so please complete the installation of your Ubuntu 22.04 system before proceeding with the installation of the project. Thank you for your co-operation.
### About project installation - Either Local or Docker
You can install this project either locally or through running a container by Docker.
